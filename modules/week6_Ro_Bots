# Week 6: Topic Ro Bots
While the original Industrial Revolution automated simple manual labor, we are in what is called The Fourth Industrial Revolution. This uses Data+AI+Robotics to increasingly take over both largely physical tasks (e.g. driving on highways and automated killing on the battlefield) as well as largely cognitive tasks (e.g. code generation and emotional care giving). How will we respond to this automation of what has long been considered the exclusive domain of humans?

## KEY QUESTIONS

1. Why do some argue that this round of automation differs from earlier waves?
2. How should we prepare? Does UBI offer a path forward? Why or why not?
3. Should we program our ethics into our machines, for example in autonomous vehicles?
4. Do LAWS provide enough benefits to justify their use?
5. Should we allow robots (or bots) to provide emotional or sexual comfort?
6. Do you think transhumanist mergings of human and machine (like neuralink) offer enough benefits to outweigh potential downsides?
