# Week 5: Topic Languages (Artificial and Natural)

This week we explore languages, both artificial (often referred to as "formal") and natural. We'll see how artificial and natural languages share underlying similarities; at the same time, individual languages can constrain how we describe and even think about reality. We'll explore the parsing/grammar approaches to understanding language, and consider four different programming paradigms.


## KEY QUESTIONS

1. How is this thought process the same or different for natural and artificial languages?
2. The programming language you are learning, Python, needs to be interpreted for the computer. On the most basic level, how does this work?
3. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and what problems does it solve?
4. Briefly compare object-oriented, procedural, functional and logic-based programming paradigms.
5. How do languages shape the way we think and even what we can imagine?
6. Theories of language are important for understanding how computers can both "understand" and generate language. What are the critiques of Chomsky? What do you think of GPT-2 (3, 4, o1) and its output? Does it tell us anything about how language works?
7. Can you explain OOO? How does this philosophical position reflect the "thought" of objected-oriented programming? Is it ethically compelling or not, and why?
