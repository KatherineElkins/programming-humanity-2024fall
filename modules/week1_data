# Week 1 : Topic Input: Data

Data, especially Big Data, has been called the "new oil." This is why data, along with an intimate understanding of its forms, is the topic for our first week. We begin by exploring how humans and computers encode data differently. If perception can fool us and is inadequate for understanding reality, does data provide the solution? To answer this, we need to understand that data can also lead to false conclusions. This technical understanding forms the background for our theoretical questions for this week. Are we data? What elements of being "you" are unquantifiable? DataCamp exercises offer a more traditional way of understanding Data Science, and these courses provide foundational concepts and skills that we will apply for humanities and social science applications.


## KEY TAKE-AWAYS

1. Compare/contrast how brains and computers collect and store data. How and why do errors arise in each?
2. How much can we rely on our perceptions and sense data? If perception is unreliable, what's the alternative?
3. What is information theory, and how does compression work? How does this help us understand the differences between "failures" of memory in brains vs. computers?
4. How can data mislead us? Do different kinds of data have different distributions? Why does this matter?
5. Are we data? What elements of "you" are unquantifiable? 

## READINGS

All readings can be found on our course website.

### CODING

See DataCamp for our coding exercises for this week. We'll begin our theoretical and applied introduction to data science (for humanities, social science and arts applications).
